  - ✅ 50–100 = success
* Examples:  
  `/me fires tranquilizer at SCP-173` → `/roll`  
  `/me shackles SCP's arms with magnetic cuffs` → `/roll`
* ✅ If successful, SCP must comply with RP.
* 👮 MTF, Containment, or Researchers must assist in some procedures.

> 📌 **SCP-096 Special Handling**
- 👁️ May only kill if a player **looks at his face**.
- 🛑 After tantrum ends, must sit still.
- 🔁 Can be recontained via:  
  `/me fires tranquilizer at SCP-096` → `/roll`  
  `/me puts bag over SCP-096's head` → `/roll`
- ✅ If successful, SCP-096 must comply.
- ⚠️ Non-compliance or abusing 096 is punishable.
